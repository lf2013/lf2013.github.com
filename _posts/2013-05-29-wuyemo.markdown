###Machine
#####VMware + Ubuntu 
Use 12.04 LTS(a stable version) instead of a unstable version.
####softwares
>vim
>git
>
#####git ssh
I have just reinstalled the system or I'v just get a new machine.
1. install git
2. get a friend usr(get ssh key)
3. add the usr as a Collaborator of the old project.
4. the usr is free to push to the origin project.    

#####ruby gem jekyll
1.install gem(sudo apt-get install ruby/rubygem)
2.gem install jekyll   
3.jekyll server --watch  #watch the change at the time you save the file.   
It seems that the new version has replaced 'auto' by 'watch'

####done
